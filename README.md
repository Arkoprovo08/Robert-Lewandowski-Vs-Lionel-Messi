## Complete Analysis on Robert Lewandowski Vs Lionel Messi

As we know there has been a lot of talk about this years Ballon d'or and we know that Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski were the main contenders by far.
While Messi won his 7th Ballon d'or there were a lot of conflicts that Lewandowski deserved it for his exceptional performances in the past 2 seasons.

I have analyzed the last 2 League seasons, Champions League 2021, the Copa America and Euro and finally concluded that if we focus on the shots and goals , Lewandowski leads in both of them. But in all round performance starting from successful dribbles, passes, assists, etc. Messi has a greater edge in all of them.
